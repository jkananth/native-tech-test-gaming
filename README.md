# Sky Betting and Gaming iOS Tech Test (Gaming Tribe)

# **Scenario**

Create a native iOS app that allows users to search for Movies using data from http://www.omdbapi.com/

## **Additional Requirements**

# Allow user entry of search parameters.
# Call the web service with your parameters and process the results.
# Display results in a UI i.e. list or collection using the images and text available. It's up to you what or how you display the data. Go wild with your UI skills.
# Save searches so that the user can go back and see their previous searches and easily re-search. These should survive an app re-start.
# Should work in landscape and portrait as well as tablet and phone.
# Use any tabs, menus etc you feel appropriate to enable searching, navigating, displaying results plus viewing and running previous searches.
# Validate your code works.
# Write code assuming that after the initial release you won't be maintaining it, but someone else will have to.

## **Expectations**

# The app should be written using the most recent version of Swift and XCode.
# We value well structured, modular, reusable code with maintainable unit tests.
# You should not use code generation tools.
# We expect you to use source control.
# Over-use of third-party libraries is discouraged, however any required dependencies should be included via Cocoapods.
# Documentation comments are encouraged.

## **What to submit**

- A bundled/archived repository showing your commit history, for example:
    git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all --branches
- A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
  
## **Equality & Diversity**

We consider all candidates equally, fairly and without bias. To that end, we ask that you do not leave any personally identifying information in your submission (such as your name within an author field or file, or in use as test data).
